# how to start
- you need to start by downloading dataset from https://recsys.eb.dk/
- place the zip files in the root of this folder and unzip it to appropriate folders
- I have also added requirements.txt if you are wondering what packages I am running
- please use venv of python - I have placed my in env/ folder but feel tree to name it differently and add an entry into .gitignore file
